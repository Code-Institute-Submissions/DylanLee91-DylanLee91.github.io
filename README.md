## Technologies Used
The webpage is almost entirely written with the help of Bootstrap 4 CSS and it's supporting jquery packages.
To assemble the arkhip font package, the font .ttf file was passed to https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator to generate the webkit for easier implementation.
## Testing

## Deployment
The website is currently deployed on [Github pages](https://dylanlee91.github.io/) and the repository is publicly viewable on [Github](https://github.com/DylanLee91/DylanLee91.github.io)

          <h1>About Eberron and the continent of Khorvaire</h1>
          <hr>
          <p class="lead">Eberron is a campaign setting for the Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game. Set in the year 998 YK, Eberron is a planet on the brink of chaos.
            A 102 year long war has only recently ended and the land reels from magical devastation. Many new countries have risen from the ashes of a shattered empire, and the
            strongest of the old world view their new neighbours with distrust and disdain. Some seek peace and prosperity while others agitate for a return to hostilities, 
            unsatisfied with the Treaty they signed. Brave and canny adventurers will find riches awaiting them should they choose
            to venture out into this brave new world! 
          </p>
          <p>Eberron was created by author and game designer Keith Baker as the winning entry for Wizards of the Coast's Fantasy Setting Search, 
            a competition run in 2002 to establish a new setting for the D&D game. Eberron was chosen from more than 11,000 entries, and was officially released with the publication of the Eberron Campaign Setting hardback book in June 2004.
          </p>
          <p>We at M.A.D are enthusiastic fans of the setting, and run games set in the campaign on a weekly and fortnightly basis. If this interests you,
            get in touch! We'll be happy to meet you.
